INSTRUCTION
------------------

DebridFF is an add-on that helps you to generate premium links from file sharing websites (e.g Rapidshare, Megaupload, Hotfile, etc) through Debridmax (http://www.debridmax.com). With this add-on, you don't have to go to the website.

To generate links, first you have to make sure that you are logged in to Debridmax. To login, just simply go to http://www.debridmax.com/login.php
To check whether you have been logged in to Debridmax, you can simply click the widget icon (located at bottom left/right):
- If you are logged in, it will show your login details and a link to open the submission window.
- If you're not logged in, there will be a link that redirects you to Debridmax website.

Basically, there are 4 ways to generate links:
1. Using the downloader window (or it is also called submission window).
	- You can open the submission window by clicking the widget icon and click "Open Downloader"
	- Copy the link(s) you want to download and simply paste it to the the links textbox
	- If a password is needed to download the links, simply type/paste it into the File Password textbox
	- Click "Go" button to generate the premium links.
	- The "Generated Links" window will show up
	   (If you're not logged in, or there are some errors with the links / the website, it will show the error message )
	- When you click "Copy All links" button, it will copy the links to the clipboard.

2. Using the Download Selected / Download All buttons
    - The buttons will show up if the pattern of the links matches with the hostFilter regular expressions and if the html contains td.code, pre, or blockquote tags.
	- For example, if you go to http://www.warez-bb.org/viewtopic.php?t=11585466(if you don't have a username here, use codervx7:forum for username:password)
	- To use "Download selected", you must select/highlight/block the link first.
	- The "Download All" button is used for downloading the link(s) which are in td.code, pre or blockquote tags beside the button.
    - After you click the button, the "Generated Links" window will show up
	
3. Using the context menu.
    - The Debridmax context menu will appear when you right-click a link or highlight/block/select a link then right-click.
	- To generate links using this, simply right click or highlight/block/select links then right-click and then choose Debridmax - Download link
	- After you click "Download link", the "Generated Links" window will show up
	- There's another menu called "send to submission window". This helps you to collect the links you want to download on the submission window. 
	
4. Using the context button. (only works when you drag the mouse)
    - The context button will show up when you highlight/block/select a link that matches the hostFilter pattern.
	- After you highlight/block/select a link (e.g http://www.megaupload.com/?d=S6PRPNL6) in the browser, you will see a little Debridmax icon beside your mouse icon. Click the little icon and the "Generated Links" window will show up.
